# my-skills.dev

This repository contains the source code of the [my-skills.dev](https://my-skills.dev) website,
a German web app to test your skills regarding current technologies
and methodologies used in modern software development.

As the app has been created a couple of hours as a project to learn
Angular, do not expect high quality code here.
